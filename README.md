# React Aria Components Adventure

Some of the experiences I had while using React Aria Components to build an accessible and user-friendly application.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run locally

Start the dev server, and the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
pnpm dev
```
